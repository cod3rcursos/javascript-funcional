Before Holt comes in

I'm gonna put ink on the podium

he'll fall for that.

Three victims, all young men,

in their own fashion.

shown that soliciting

you could help us

doesn't mean that
I'm inhuman, Jake.

We can't just fire somebody.

followed up on it,

- No, I agree, Peralta.
It's excellent work.

I like giving compliments.

It is very commanding.

I do musical theater.

331
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:54,479
It's the hardest form of acting.
- I agree!

332
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:56,917
I am always saying,
if you're not singing,

333
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,875
you're not acting.
- Right!

334
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,311
- It's probably hard
to audition

335
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:02,009
because you're always here,
right?

336
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:05,186
- Yes! I had to pass up a chance
to read for "Seussical."

00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:07,014
- You know Brian,
this makes me think

338
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:08,363
of something I saw on "Ellen."

339
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:11,018
There was this lady,
she wanted to be a cook,

340
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:12,846
but her tongue
was all messed up,

341
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:15,979
and she had this friend
who didn't even have a tongue--

342
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,459
I mean, she did,

343
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:21,028
and now they own a taco truck
in Lansing!

344
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:22,333
- Huh?

345
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:23,726
- Follow your dreams, man!

346
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,206
You gotta follow your dreams.

347
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:27,469
Find your taco truck!

348
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:30,211
- Wow.
Thank you.

349
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:32,126
That gives me
a lot to think about.

350
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:33,475
So what did you
come down here for?

351
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:38,001
- Oh, uh, I had to borrow...

352
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:39,350
the water cooler!

353
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:41,309
[grunting] All right.
Thanks, Brian.

354
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:43,006
Think about what I said.

355
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,922
- So, the tipster saw
the Saturn parked out back

356
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:47,228
and the woman at the desk said

357
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:48,751
it belongs to the man
in room 203.

358
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:51,362
One "Larry Bird."
- Obvious fake name.

359
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:53,408
- Or is it so insane that
there's no way it's fake?

360
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:54,931
If you're trying not
to draw attention,

361
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,672
why not go with something
like "John Smith?"

362
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,760
- From "Pocahontas"?

363
00:11:57,804 --> 00:11:59,719
Uh, yeah.
Way to fly under the radar.

364
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:00,632
[laughs]

365
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:02,460
- Excuse me, is there ice yet?

366
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:03,766
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't work here.

367
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,376
I'm a police officer.

368
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,074
- Well, then I'd like
to lodge a formal complaint.

369
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:08,597
There hasn't been ice here
for days

370
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,512
and everyone knows
my wine coolers are supposed

371
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:12,079
to be served chilled.
- You're an adult.

372
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:13,428
Why are you
drinking wine coolers?

373
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:15,082
- Because I'm on vacation.
- Okay.

374
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,040
Well, I'll mention the ice.

375
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:18,607
- Thanks.
Pig.

376
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,087
- Okay.

377
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,002
[phone ringing]

378
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:23,394
- Oh, it's Holt.

379
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:24,395
I didn't tell him
what we were doing.

380
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:25,788
- I'll act natural.

381
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:27,137
- You're not gonna be
on the phone call.

382
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:28,356
Just do nothing.
Hey, Captain!

383
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,923
- What delicious water
I'm drinking!

384
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:31,707
- [growls] Sorry that we didn't
check in before we left.

385
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,274
We're just down
at the DMV following up

386
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:34,841
on the Saturn owners.
- Lies!

387
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:36,843
- Captain!
How'd you know we were here?

388
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:38,192
- I followed you!

389
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:39,846
John Kelly gave you
a "Hot Clue," didn't he?

390
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:41,238
How dare you disobey me.

391
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:42,631
- Come on, sir,
it was a good tip

392
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:43,980
and we're trying
to catch a serial killer.

393
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:45,329
- Well then let's see
this tip,

394
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:47,505
this groundbreaking tip

395
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:49,029
that threatens
to blow the case wide open.

396
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:51,335
- Okay, I know this tone.
Here comes petty Holt.

397
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:52,510
- Naw, bitch.
I'm not being petty.

398
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:53,860
- You just said, "naw, bitch."

399
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:55,818
- Show me the tip.
- [exasperated sigh]

400
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:57,515
[whispers]
Title of your sex tape.

401
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,039
- I was behind
the Royal Motor Inn.

402
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:01,911
I saw a guy get out
of a blue Saturn Ion

403
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:03,260
and he was covered in blood.

404
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:04,696
Anyway, Baba Booey!

405
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,655
- Baba Booey?
Is that a clue?

406
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:08,831
- Uh, I don't know what
Baba Booey means, actually.

407
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,181
- It's a popular prank phrase
from Howard Stern.

408
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:13,488
- Charles!
- Oh, from a shock jock.

409
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:14,837
Well, that changes everything.

410
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:17,797
Now we have
a credible break in the case.

411
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,146
Baba Booey!

412
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:20,843
[hard knocking]
NYPD, open up!

413
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:22,192
- Uh, just a minute!

414
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:24,499
- Ooh, I bet
he's frantically packing up

415
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:25,892
his collection of hearts.

416
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:27,415
[glass breaking]

417
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,373
- Goin' in!
Get back.

418
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:32,812
- There's blood everywhere!
- He went out the window.

419
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,944
- I'll go around back.

420
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:37,294
- Fine, Kelly found the
murderer's kill room.

421
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:39,340
Whoop-dee-doo!
Should we throw him a parade?

422
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,342
- Yeah!
Maybe!

423
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:43,997
.

424
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,912
- Patrols have searched
a five-block radius.

425
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,522
No sign of the perp.

426
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:49,045
- And there were no prints.
He was wearing gloves.

427
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:50,438
- Like the inimitable
Audrey Hepburn.

428
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:52,048
- Nope.
- Gentlemen, there's something

429
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:53,789
I need to say.
I gave you such a hard time

430
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,792
about using Commissioner Kelly's
app because I was being petty.

431
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,012
I wanted him to fail
and I took it out on you

432
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:03,016
and for that I am very...

433
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:05,322
- Oh. You kind of trailed off
there, sir.

434
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,063
Were you going
to finish your sentence?

435
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:08,456
It felt like you were going
to say you were sorry.

436
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:09,979
- I did.
Boyle heard it.

437
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:11,807
- Uh, I would remember if
someone said my catch phrase.

438
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,896
- Fine, I'm sorry.

439
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,898
I'm very sorry.

440
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:17,900
- Apology accepted.

441
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:20,076
I am so proud of you.
- Peralta.

442
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,382
- You're right.
I'll rub it in later.

443
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:22,905
What matters now
is solving this case.

444
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:24,385
Now, our murderer
may have gotten away,

445
00:14:24,428 --> 00:14:26,300
but we did find
his kill room.

446
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:28,128
Maybe there's something in here
that we're not seeing, yet.

447
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,043
- Perhaps we should pay your
cannibal friend another visit.

448
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:32,828
- I wouldn't say they're friends
so much as ex-cellmates.

449
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,482
- No, it's true.
We're friends.

450
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:37,615
- He ate kids!
- Well, people are complicated.

451
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:38,834
- Now, I'll tell you one thing.

452
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,270
You are not looking
for a cannibal.

453
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:42,055
- Why do you say that?
- With all that blood?

454
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:44,927
- No self-respecting cannibal
would waste all that sauce.

455
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:46,407
- See, Charles?
He's a foodie, like you.

456
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,844
- Who are you?
- Can I see that picture again?

457
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,890
Oh man, those are
some nice tools.

458
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,543
I would love
to spread some ribs

459
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:53,936
using that sternum retractor,

460
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,242
but they only sell those
to hospitals.

461
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:57,157
- Wait a minute.
What did you just say?

462
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,246
- I said I'd love
to get my little fingies

463
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:00,464
in some chesties.

464
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:01,944
- No, no, no.
Not the super gross part.

465
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,163
Surgery-grade tools,

466
00:15:03,206 --> 00:15:04,338
precise incisions
around the heart,

467
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:06,035
and there was no ice
at the motel.

468
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,950
- Because the perp was using
it for the hearts.

469
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,952
- We're not looking
for a serial killer.

470
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:11,867
He stole the hearts
for a transplant!

471
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,260
- Boom!
We solved it.

472
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:15,610
Boyle, give me a hug.
- Yeah!

473
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:18,004
[all screaming]
- No!

474
00:15:18,656 --> 00:15:20,180
- Hey, I did it!

475
00:15:20,223 --> 00:15:22,182
I talked to Brian and encouraged
him to pursue his dreams.

476
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:23,705
- Really?
Is he gonna quit?

477
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:25,272
- I don't know,
that was the first step.

478
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:27,143
But I figure
if I talk to him twice a day

479
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:29,145
for the next few weeks--
- Attention, everyone!

480
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:31,278
Today will be my final day
at the Nine-Nine.

481
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:32,975
- Damn, Loot.
That was fast.

482
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:34,455
- I will be taking my talents
to Broadway

483
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:36,457
and I owe it all
to Lieutenant Terry Jeffords.

484
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,111
- All I did was
believe in you.

485
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:39,416
- And it changed everything.

486
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,853
So Lieutenant,
this one's for you.

487
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,290

is your ass to jail.
